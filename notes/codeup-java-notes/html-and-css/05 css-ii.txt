------- OVERVIEW -------

- fixed layout: the layout is specified in hardcoded pixel values
- fluid layout: the layout is specified in percentages, but does not change based on screen size
- responsive layout: the layout uses media queries to change based on screen size


------- MEDIA QUERIES -------

Responsive Web Design:
- RWD
- crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience
- easy reading, navigation, minimum resizing, panning, and scrolling
- from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones
- coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010


Setting the Viewport:
- viewport meta tag instructs the page to match the screen's width
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">


Media Queries:
- the most important tool in your belt when it comes to building a responsive website
- make changes based on the pixel width of the viewable area

    /* screen sizes 500px and up */
    @media screen and (min-width:500px) {
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
    }

    /* screen sizes between 960px and 1200px */
    @media screen and (min-width:960px) and (max-width:1200px) {
        /* ... */
    }


Breakpoints:
- referred to as major resolution changes
- specified with media queries
- use popular device configurations
- layout elements are broken and repositioned

    /* Small devices (phones and pocket devices, 576 and up) */
    @media screen and (min-width:576px) { /* ... */ }

    /* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
    @media screen and (min-width:768px) { /* ... */ }

    /* Large devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
    @media screen and (min-width:992px) { /* ... */ }

    /* Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
    @media screen and (min-width:1200px) { /* ... */ }


Mobile First Approach:
- writing your default styling for a mobile device
- use media queries to change the layout based on larger devices
- support mobile and build up from there
- larger first complicates as you break a design down to fit
* CSS px !== device px
    + device-width media query measures the width of the device in device pixels
    + width media query measures the total width of the page in CSS pixels

    Q: What is a layout viewport?
    A: Itâ€™s the area (in CSS pixels) that the browser uses to calculate the dimensions
       of elements with percent-ual width, the width of this layout viewport is constrained
       to the device width in device pixels.

       Nexus screen size = 480px, but when you apply the <meta> tag it acts as if the screen
       width is 320px, 2/3rds of the official width.

       dips; device-independent pixels

* Rule
    + The @media at-rule may be placed at the top level of your code or nested inside
      any other conditional group at-rule.
