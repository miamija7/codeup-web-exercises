What is an API?
- Application Programming Interface
- An API is any way for one application or program to communicate with another one
- "APIs in JavaScript," typically means services that can send or retrieve data over the internet using ajax
- RESTful APIs:
    + REpresentational State Transfer
    + The REST architectural style defines six guiding constraints. When these constraints are applied to
      the system architecture, it gains desirable non-functional properties, such as performance, scalability,
      simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.[1] A system that complies with some
      or all of these constraints is loosely referred to as RESTful.

      The formal REST constraints are as follows:
      - Clientâ€“server architecture
      - Statelessness
      - Cacheability
      - Layered system
      - Code on demand (optional)
      - Uniform interface
