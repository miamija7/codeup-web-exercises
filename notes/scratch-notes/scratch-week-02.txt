VAR VS. LET:
let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement,
or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally,
or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

INTELLIJ:
"log" + tab                 shortcut -> console.log();
