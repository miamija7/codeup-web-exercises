*** JAVASCRIPT LOOPS ***


WHILE LOOP:
// execute as long as a certain condition is true
    while (condition) {
      statement
    }


DO WHILE LOOP:
// execute at least once before evaluating if a certain condition is true
    do {
       statement
    } while (condition);


FOR LOOP:
// use when how many times the loop needs to run is known
    for (initialization; condition; increment) {
        statement
    };


KEYWORDS:
BREAK -> this keyword allows you to exit the loop at any time
CONTINUE -> skip to the next loop iteration without completing the entire loop code block
