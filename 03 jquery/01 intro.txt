What is jQuery?
- a cross-platform JavaScript library
- designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML
- released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig
- jQuery is the most widely used JavaScript library on the internet today.
- 77.6% of all sites use jQuery (as of 23rd February 2021)


*** BONUS: REACT.JS ***

What is React?
- React.js (also known as ReactJS or React) is an open-source, front-end JavaScript library
- created in 2013 by Jordan Walke, who works at Facebook as a software engineer
- debugging and testing more easily
- Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp all use React

What is an API?
- Application Programming Interface
- An API is any way for one application or program to communicate with another one
- "APIs in JavaScript," typically means services that can send or retrieve data over the internet using ajax
- RESTful APIs:
    + REpresentational State Transfer
    + The REST architectural style defines six guiding constraints. When these constraints are applied to
      the system architecture, it gains desirable non-functional properties, such as performance, scalability,
      simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.[1] A system that complies with some
      or all of these constraints is loosely referred to as RESTful.

      The formal REST constraints are as follows:
      - Clientâ€“server architecture
      - Statelessness
      - Cacheability
      - Layered system
      - Code on demand (optional)
      - Uniform interface

Using jQuery:
- install locally or use CDN linking
- release types: compressed (production) and uncompressed (development)


Downloading jQuery:
- https://jquery.com/download/
- Download Versions: https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/
    + "uncompressed" link -> Save Link As... -> js folder
    + in html reference like this: <script src="/js/jquery.js"></script>


CDN jQuery link:
- <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js" integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
- retrieve the jQuery source code from the CDN provided


The jQuery object:
- API Documentation: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
- use the jQuery object to find and create HTML elements from the DOM
- jQuery Object API returns a collection elements either found in the DOM or created by passing an HTML string
- use $, as an alias of jQuery to reference the jQuery object


Document Ready:
- determine if the window has finished loading
- fires when DOM is ready, after images download

    window.onload = function() {
        alert( 'The page has finished loading!' );
    }

- pass an anonymous handler function into the jQuery instance
- fires when DOM is ready, before images download
- $() will execute when the document is ready for JavaScript manipulation

    $(function() {
        alert( 'The DOM has finished loading!' );
    });

- If we put our JavaScript at the bottom of our document, it will already be loaded by the time the
  JavaScript is loaded. Using the function above will ensure the DOM is loaded before running.
- JavaScript should "use strict"; and live inside a $(function(){}) function
