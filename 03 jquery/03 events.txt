*** JQUERY - EVENTS ***


jQuery Events:
- use jQuery to attach event listeners to HTML elements
- simplifies working with different types of events across browsers
- events like a user clicking a mouse, hovering over an element, or bringing areas in and out of focus


Mouse Events:
.click() — Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.
.dblclick() — Bind an event handler to the "dblclick" JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.
.hover() — Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements.
