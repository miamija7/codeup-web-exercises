*** JQUERY - EVENTS ***


jQuery Events:
- use jQuery to attach event listeners to HTML elements
- simplifies working with different types of events across browsers
- events like a user clicking a mouse, hovering over an element, or bringing areas in and out of focus


Mouse Events:
.click() — Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.
.dblclick() — Bind an event handler to the "dblclick" JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.
.hover() — Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements.


Event Handlers Refresher:
- event listener/handler function is a callback function that is called when an event happens
- when called, the handler function is passed an event object
- event object contains details about the event and methods for modifying the event, ex. preventDefault
- event object can be omitted from the function definition if it is not used
- we can attach an anonymous function as a callback function
- we can attach a named function as a callback function
- anonymous function can be refactored to be a named function

    // anonymous function
    var ele = document.getElementById('my-element');
    ele.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
        alert('My element was clicked!');
    });

    // named function
    function clickHandler(e) {
        alert('My element was clicked!');
    }
    var ele = document.getElementById('my-element');
    ele.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);

    // jQuery
    $( selector ).click( handler )


.click():
- on click event
    $('selector').click(function() {
        alert('click event!');
    });


.dbclick():
- on double click
    $('selector').dblclick(function(e) {
        alert('double click event!');
    });

.hover():
- combination of mouseenter and mouseleave events
    $('selector').hover( handlerIn, handlerOut )


$(this):
- reference the selected DOM element
- available inside a callback function
- refer to the selected DOM element that triggered the event
