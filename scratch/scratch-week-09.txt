BRANCHES:
- it is not good practice to push to main
- push to your own branch, go to GitHub
- pull request/merge (YOU DON'T MERGE YOUR OWN BRANCHES)
- return to local machine and update your main (branch is updated, main is behind)
git checkout main
git fetch                   looks at all of your trunks (not commonly used)
git pull origin main
