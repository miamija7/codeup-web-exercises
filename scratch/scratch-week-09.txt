INTELLIJ:
variable.log                console.log(variable);
string.substring(0,1);      string.[0];


BRANCHES:
- it is not good practice to push to main
- push to your own branch, go to GitHub
- pull request/merge (YOU DON'T MERGE YOUR OWN BRANCHES)
- return to local machine and update your main (branch is updated, main is behind)
git checkout main
git fetch                   looks at all of your trunks (not commonly used)
git pull origin main


LIFECYCLE OF BRANCHES:
- production branch and development branch
- git checkout for phases of project
- "abandon" branches as you go
- "hoard" branches


DESTRUCTURING! :)
const { payload: { commits: [ { message: myCommit } ] } } = data[2];
// console.log(payload.commits[0].message);
console.log(myCommit);


JSON SERVER:
fetch("https://grass-orchid-breath.glitch.me/books").then(res => res.json());

CRUD:
- Create        POST
- Read          GET
- Update        PUT/PATCH
- Delete        DELETE


PUT vs PATCH:
- PUT will replace the whole with the provided information
- PATCH will replace/add the provided fields


RETURN TO AN OLD PUSH
git checkout -b main HASH
