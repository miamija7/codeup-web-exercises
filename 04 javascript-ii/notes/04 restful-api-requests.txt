*** JAVASCRIPT II - RESTFUL API REQUESTS NOTES ***


Example of routes for a Blog site:
    route	        method	            description
    /posts	        GET	                Fetch a (paginated) list of all the posts
    /posts	        POST	            Create a new post
    /posts/{id}	    GET	                View the information about a specific post
    /posts/{id}	    PUT or PATCH	    Modify the existing post
    /posts/{id}	    DELETE	            Delete a post

- PUT would be used to update an entire resource at once
- PATCH should be used to just modify a specific attribute of a resource
- most RESTful APIs requests translate to URLs


POSTing Data:
- we have only used fetch for GET requests...
- we also need:
    + POST - send requests that create new data
    + PUT/PATCH - update existing data
