*** JAVASCRIPT II - PROMISES NOTES ***

Promises:
- a tool for handling asynchronous events in JavaScript
- a promise represents an event that might not yet have happened
- three states:

pending         the event has not yet happened
resolved        the event has happened successfully
rejected        the event has happened, and an error condition occurred


Fetch API:
then            accepts a callback that will run when the promise is resolved.
catch           accepts a callback that will run when the promise is rejected.
    fetch('https://api.github.com/users')
    .then(response => console.log(response))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
